# Regression-Computational-Intelligence
The purpose of this assignment is to investigate the ability of TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Tang) models to fit multivariable, nonlinear functions. Especially, using two datasets from the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and fuzzy neural models, we are trying to estimate the target attribute from the available data.

## Part 1
The first dataset is used for a simple investigation of the training and evaluation process of such models, as well as illustrating manners of analyzing and interpreting the results.

###### The dataset used is the _Airfoil Self-Noise dataset_ and you can find it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/airfoil+self-noise).

## Part 2
The second and more complicated dataset is used for a more complete modeling process, which involves, among others, preprocessing steps such as feature selection and methods for optimizing models through cross validation.

###### The dataset used is the _Superconductivty dataset_ and you can find it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data).
